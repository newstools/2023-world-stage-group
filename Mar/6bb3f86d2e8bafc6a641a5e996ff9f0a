Iran has reached an agreement with the United States on a prisoner exchange, Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said on Sunday. “Regarding a prisoner exchange, we have reached an agreement with the U.S. in the last few days,” the minister said on Sunday, according to a report by the state news agency ISNA. If “everything goes well,” the exchange will take place in the next few days, he said. The two countries have been enemies for decades. There was initially no comment from the U.S. government. Iran repeatedly imprisons foreigners on charges of espionage or other violations of national security. Human rights activists criticise the trials, which are often held behind closed doors, as unfair. The Islamic Republic is also accused of holding foreigners hostage. A prisoner exchange could lead to the resumption of negotiations on Iran’s nuclear programme, which have been deadlocked for months. Iran needs an agreement to end the economic crisis. Among the best-known prisoners in Iran is businessman Siamak Namazi, who holds dual U.S. and Iranian citizenship. The 51-year-old was imprisoned with his father in 2015 and then sentenced to 10 years in prison for espionage. Baquer Namazi, 86, was released in 2022 under an agreement with the U.S., but his son is still in the notorious Evin prison in the capital Tehran.
