Alhaji Jamil Gwamna, the Coordinator of the Tinubu/Shettima Campaign in Gombe State, has urged opposition parties to embrace peace and support the President-elect, Sen. Bola Tinubu, for the task of nation-building. Gwamna who made the appeal in an interview with newsmen in Gombe on Thursday, said Tinubu’s victory is the will of the people. According to him, Tinubu’s victory at the polls shows that democracy has come to stay in Nigeria. He said it is necessary for all democrats, irrespective of party affiliations, to support Tinubu for the task of promoting peace and development for the good of all citizens. Gwamna said the President-elect’s pledge to work with all stakeholders towards building a more prosperous nation, showed his statesmanship and readiness to provide the right leadership and inclusive governance. “Tinubu’s victory is a very good moment for Nigeria and we must commend all democrats who made this happen across the country. “Elections all over the world as we know are never perfect. Even the last election in America we all witnessed, many people including the president refusing to accept the result but eventually he did. “So I urge all those that have felt bitter about the outcome of the election to please embrace peace for the sake of our country. “Because without peace, there will be no Nigeria. We need to embrace peace and respect one another’s beliefs and party affiliations because what unites us is more than what divides us,” he said. Gwamna, while commending President Muhammadu Buhari for providing the good leadership that had endeared Nigerians to APC, also commended supporters of APC and all those who elected Tinubu in Gombe State. “I want to appeal to all our citizens in the state to come out en masse on March 11 to replicate APC’s victory at the national level in Gombe State by re-electing Gov Inuwa Yahaya of Gombe State.
