Mr Adam Hamza, Managing Director of Olaf IT solutions, has urged Nigerian startups to focus their innovations around providing solutions to real life human problems. Olaf IT solutions is an Abuja based hub that addresses problems on Information Technology and online safety. Hamza spoke on Friday in Abuja during an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). He urged startups to avoid ideas that were ‘solutions for solutions sake and solve a problem people are seeking solutions to’. “There are myriad problems facing our country that are ripe for problem-solving such as parking, congestion, energy, water, employment, education, food security – the list is long. “ These problems need innovators or start-ups who understand that technology innovations and ideas at its core solves problems, enables efficiency and makes life easier. “ When you understand the problems of the people you’re trying to reach and then design and develop from their perspective, you will arrive at ideas that they will embrace, ’he said. Hamza said products and solutions to problems should not be tailored towards solving end-user problems for only money or academic purposes. “ Human-centered innovation is a very good choice nowadays because the process starts with people and ends with innovative solutions that are tailor made to suit the needs of the target. “For innovation to be successful, the perspective of every human directly and indirectly impacted by the innovation needs to be top of mind. “This line of thinking needs to start as early as the ideation phase and move all the way through to full-scale operation,’’ he said.
