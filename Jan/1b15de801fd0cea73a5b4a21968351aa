WorldStage Newsonline– The National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) has said that  65.7 per cent of eligible Nigerians have so far received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Dr Bulama Garuba, NPHCDA Director, Planning, Research and Statistics, said this in Abuja while giving update on COVID-19 response and development during the Ministerial bi-weekly meeting of the agency. “At the start of the COVID-19 vaccination exercise, we targeted to vaccinate 70 per cent of our eligible population by December 2022. “As of today, Monday, January 9th 2023, 76,161,470 eligible persons have received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccines in Nigeria, representing 65.7 per cent of our eligible population. “64,094,498 persons have been fully vaccinated and this represents 55.3 per cent of our eligible population, and 9,892,018 have received their booster doses. “This year, we have seen an increase in the number of our eligible population from 111,773,503 to 115,983,921 as a result of an increase in several persons who turned 18 years,” he said. Garuba said the fight against COVID-19 was not over as a new variant of the virus, XBB.1.5, has emerged in the United States. “XBB.1.5  is quickly becoming the dominant strain in parts of the United States and has been detected in at least 28 other countries, according to the World Health Organization. “It is because of a potent mix of mutations that makes it easier to spread broadly. “The XBB.1.5 has been pegged by the World Health Organization as “the most transmissible” descendant yet of the omicron variant,” the director added. He said that the increase in the number of cases seen globally is a result of a mutation that is occurring and the low intake of booster doses. “We are therefore calling on all Nigerians to ensure that they take their booster doses of the COVID-19 vaccines. “Just like the flu vaccine, the COVID-19 vaccines have become routinized vaccines that help protect us against this deadly virus,” Garuba said. According to him, the Agency is continuously working with all stakeholders at National, State and Local Government levels to increase awareness, social mobilization and coverage. He said that as of Jan. 7, the country has a COVID-19 vaccine stock balance of 28,968,045 doses. “More vaccines are still expected over the coming weeks. “We, therefore, encourage all Nigerians to visit the nearest government facility to ensure they are up to date with either their first, second or booster doses. “The COVID -19 vaccines are available, they are free and they are safe,” he added. Garuba said that the agency would continue to work with partners to ensure that low-performing states were pushed to ensure full coverage of all eligible population. “Remember, it is not yet over, we must continue to work together to ensure Nigerians remain fully protected against the virus,” he said.
