WorldStage Newsonline– The Department of State Services (DSS) said it has intercepted some syndicates in parts of the country for allegedly selling the new redesigned Naira notes. This is contained in a statement issued by Dr Peter Afunanya, the Public Relations Officer of the DSS on Monday in Abuja. He said the syndicates were intercepted by operatives of the service during an operation. “Investigation has also shown that some Commercial Bank officials were aiding the  economic malfeasance. “Consequently, the Service warns the currency racketeers to desist from this ignoble act. “Appropriate regulatory authorities are, in this same vein, urged to step up monitoring and supervisory activities to expeditiously  address the emerging trends,” he said. He said the DSS has ordered its commands and formations to further ensure that all persons and groups engaged in the illegal sale of the notes were identified. The DSS spokesman, therefore, urged anyone with useful information relating to the sales of the new currency to pass the same to relevant authorities.
