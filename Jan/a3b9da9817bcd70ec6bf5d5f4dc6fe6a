WorldStage Newsonline– The Federal Government of Nigeria has again raised the alarm over increase in the use of fake news and disinformation to destabilise the electoral process and plunge the nation into crisis. The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed said the worrisome trend was being perpetrated by destabilising agents, some of them linked to the opposition. Mohammed made this known on Tuesday in Abuja at the 21st edition of the President Muhammadu Buhari’ (PMB) Administration Scorecard Series (2015-2023). The scorecard series, organised to showcase the achievements of the PMB Administration featured the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Adeniyi Adebayo. Mohammed said the increasing wave of fake news and disinformation, permeating especially the social media space, in the run-up to the general election portended danger. He recalled that he reiterated the same challenge at several fora including two previous editions of the scorecard series Mohammed reassured that the government would not stand by and allow “some miscreants with access to phones and data” to destabilise the country.” Mohammed said: “I am therefore warning the purveyors of fake news and disinformation to desist. “The government is not and cannot be helpless because we have a range of options to checkmate the use of fake news and disinformation. “We are looking at the best options to ensure that the agents of destabilisation do not thwart the success of the elections with their unscrupulous resort to fake news and disinformation. “A word is enough for the wise.” After Mohammed’s opening remarks, Adebayo gave the scorecards of his ministry.
