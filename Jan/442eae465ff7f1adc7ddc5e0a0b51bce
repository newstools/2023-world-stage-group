WorldStage Newsonline– The Senate has tasked the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to ensure that the 2023 general election is free, fair and credible. President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, said this on Tuesday, in his welcome address on resumption of plenary after Christmas and New Year break. Lawan charged the electoral umpire to be on top of its game to ensure that the election met Nigerians expectations. “No excuses. INEC has gotten everything it had asked for. “We re-commit ourselves to ensuring that we support INEC and any other agency of government that works to ensure free, fair and credible election in this year and even beyond. “We also want to assure Nigerians that this is an opportunity to vote whoever they want to vote for. “Of course, we believe that citizens have done the right by obtaining their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) because without your PVC, you cannot vote,” he said. Lawan said that the National Assembly did a tremendous job by amending the Electoral Act. “The electoral act as constituted today, will provide better outcomes of elections,” he said. He said that security agencies have assured that the environment would be safe and secured for citizens to go out and cast their votes without hindrance. The senate president also said that the senate would continue to look into the issue of insufficient revenue for government. “Revenue deficit has been a major problem affecting performance of government. “Our committee on finance and other finance-related committees must be on top of their game to ensure that we get these agencies of government to remit the revenues that they collect,” he said.
