The management of Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC) on Saturday apologised to its customers in Lagos and Ogun states over irregular power supply they were currently experiencing. Mr Godwin Idemudia, the General Manager, Corporate Communications, EKEDC, made the appeal in a statement in Lagos. Idemudia attributed the irregular power supply being experienced to reduced load capacity from the National Grid. He said that the outage affected some customers in some parts of Badagry and Ogun State under Agbara District of the company. Idemudia, however, assured the residents that normalcy would be restored to the affected communities as soon as the capacity was increased. “What we are presently getting from the grid is not enough to meet the demand of our customers. “At the same time, this is to notify our esteemed customers in Lagos Island of an impending maintenance work scheduled for Sunday, Jan.22, between 9 a.m. – 1p.m. “This maintenance work will require fowler injection substation to be temporarily shut down. “So, Ikoyi and environs under Island District, will be out of supply during the period of the outage. “We are, therefore, appealing to customers to bear with us. “EKEDC highly regrets any inconveniences caused by this irregular supply,” he said. Idemudia also appealed to customers to be vigilant at this crucial time to prevent hoodlums from vandalising their cables.
