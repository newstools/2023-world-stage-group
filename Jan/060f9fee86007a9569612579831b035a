WorldStage Newsonline– Dr Jummai Adamu, Director-General of Federal Institute for Industrial Research(FIIRO), said it had  conducted cutting edge research on some raw materials in Nigeria leading to the development of no fewer than 250 technologies. Speaking on FIIRO’s day at the 7th edition of STI Expo 2023 in Abuja on Tuesday, she said the development of these technologies had resulted in the creation of profitable enterprises leading to the generation of jobs. She said that this was part of the Institute’s contributions towards the diversification agenda of the Federal Government driven by innovation. “We also focused on R&D activities that are market driven, demand-oriented and can move Nigeria from import dependent to sustainable self-reliant and production for exports,” she said. Adamu listed some of the Institute’s achievements to include the development and production of high nutrient biscuits for school age children. She also mentioned development and production of ready-to-use therapeutic foods for the management of severe acute malnutrition and nutraceuticals for the management of diseases such as sickle cell anaemia. Other achievements were the development of antilemouc/hypolipidemic from selected fruits for the management of obesit and the ytilisation of neem extracts for production of Neem skin care/oral hygiene products. Adamu said FIIRO had developed and produced fishmeal analogue from alternative sources. She added that they had produced and utilised industrial enzymes, developed and processed fresh tomatoes into different food forms as well as numerous other achievements. The FIIRO D-G said they were in collaborations with organisations such as Mountain Top University and Jebba Paper Mill Industries, among others, in trying to develop the STI sector. Adamu said there were new R&D products, goods and services embarked by FIIRO for presentation at the expo. She urged investors and partners to invest in the Institute’s cutting edge R&D products.
