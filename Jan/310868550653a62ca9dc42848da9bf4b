The governor said: “My good people of Oyo State, as the end of my first tenure as your Governor draws close, I must express my deepest gratitude to you, the good people of Oyo State, for this privilege to serve you. I do not take for granted the support you have given our administration through the  years. “Without your mandate and support, we would not have succeeded in placing our dear state on the path to sustainable development. All the work we did under the Roadmap to Accelerated Development in Oyo State 2019-2023, was leading up to this moment. “The past 43 months are a testament to our commitment to serving our people. We have shown our people that it is possible to focus on infrastructural development while at the same time, meeting our other obligations to the people. “Every year, when I write to you at this time, I recap our activities for the year and show you how we have acted like the “faithful servant” who increased his master’s talent. This year is not any different. “Although this is an election year, when most states suspend governance to face politics, we continued to work for you. “In the first quarter of 2022, we completed and commissioned the 9.7 km Saki Township Road and the 5.2 km Gedu-Oroki-Sabo-Asipa Road. By the second quarter, we handed over 100 operational vehicles to Oyo Amotekun to facilitate their operations. “We also removed the embargo on the promotion of civil servants placed by the past administration and promoted civil servants. “Additionally, we commissioned the Challenge and Ojoo Bus Terminals along with the Omituntun Buses, the foundation of a new transport infrastructure in Oyo State. We also kept our promise by commissioning the reconstructed Sasa Market. “By quarter three of 2022, we commissioned the renovated and equipped General Hospital,Tede in Atisbo Local Government Area, the 7.2 km Idi Ape-Basorun-Akobo-Odogbo Barracks Road dualisation project and the 65 metres General Gas Flyover constructed by our administration. “And this last quarter, we finally put to rest all the speculations from naysayers regarding the prompt payment of salaries and pensions of civil servants by paying for the fourth consecutive year, the 13th-month salaries of civil servants in Oyo State. As promised, we have never paid any monthly salary with “bear with us.” “We also completed the recruitment and training of 500 additional Amotekun Corps personnel to deter crime and maintain public order in our state. “Lastly, we are pleased to have completed the process of upgrading the Emmanuel Alayande College of Education, Oyo into a University of Education. “We have shown empathy in decision-making. Our policies have always been ‘people first’ because you, the good people of Oyo State, are the most important stakeholders in governance. We may not always get it right, but we have always accepted our errors and made amends where possible. “We have listened to and learnt from you, so we confidently return to you and ask for a second term. We know that come March 11, 2023, you will vote for Omituntun 2.0. “We look forward to an exciting year ahead! “May 2023 be the year we install sustainable development in Oyo State. “Let me once again use this opportunity to wish you all a rewarding and fulfilling 2023.”
