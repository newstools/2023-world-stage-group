WorldStage Newsonline– As Nigeria continues to explore and expand application of Information Technology (IT) to improving every sector of human life, the Co-founder and CEO of 9jacodekids Academy, Mr. Ugochukwu Nkwocha has identified ignorance of IT as a major factor dragging the sector backward from optimizing its potentials. Nkwocha in an exclusive interview with WorldstageTelevision  for the Startups on WorldStage (#SoW) project said Nigeria as well as other African countries have failed to emulate the US, UK, China, Canada and other developed nations in embedding in school curriculum subjects that would help shoot them into advancement of the sector and help improve quality of lives and economy. It was in realization of this gap that he said 9jacodekids was set up. He said, “We started this because we realized that countries like US, UK, China, Canada etc in preparation for fourth industrial revolution were beginning to include some tech-friendly subjects into the curriculum for their kids from primary school to secondary school and made it compulsory for the kids to see the importance of the initiative. “But come here to Nigeria and Africa, it wasn’t even something that anybody is thinking about. So we decided to start to teach the skills so that our kids can be able to compete with their peers in these countries however how we started. That’s what we’re all about”. Specifically, he explained that 9jacodekids  is a platform with a mission to teach and kit up young people between the age of four and 16 on coding and robotics programmes. On government’s position with regard to the need for the concept, he said government did not key into it in the past until things began to change from 2017 when Lagos government started to talk about encoding for Lagos. “So I think some states have some ideas of what it is. But I think they lack either the manpower or the will power to actually enforce it,” he added.
