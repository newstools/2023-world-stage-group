FC Barcelona coach Xavi will welcome former teammate and World Cup winner Lionel Messi back with open arms in the case of a shock return to the Spanish top club. “The best player in the world and in history will always fit in. This is his home and the doors are always open for him,” Xavi said ahead of Barca’s Europa League play-off match at Manchester United later on Thursday. Messi’s contract with French champions Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) expires after the season. This is in the midst of reported interest from Major League Soccer (MLS) club Inter Miami, and an alleged super-rich offer from Al Hilal in Saudi Arabia where Cristiano Ronaldo now plays at Al Nassr. There is also as well a possible return to Barca where he had spent his entire career until 2021. The rumour mill in Spain accelerated this week when several media reported that Jorge Messi, Lionel’s father and agent, had recently met Barca president Joan Laporta, with Messi’s future among the issues discussed. Xavi said further that he was in regular contact with Messi and that “a lot will depend on him and what he wants to do in the future.”
