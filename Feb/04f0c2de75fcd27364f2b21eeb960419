Lagos residents on Sunday applauded the conduct of the Feb. 25 Presidential and National Assembly (NASS) elections in the state, and attributed the success to efforts of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and Nigerians. A cross-section of residents who recounted their experiences in separate interviews with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos, said the elections seem to be the most outstanding exercise so far. Mr Gbolahan Rasaki who resides in the Epe area of Lagos State expressed satisfaction with the peaceful conduct of voting in his area. He said “I never thought the exercise would be seamless as I experienced yesterday; we give thanks to God. “Voting was smooth, calm and orderly in Epe Divisional area of Lagos State.” Mr Laja Omolaja, another resident of Lagos who resides in Ikorodu, attributed the success of the Feb. 25 elections to both INEC and Nigerians. He said that the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) functioned smoothly, and the INEC officials coordinated and organised voting in an orderly manner. Omolaja said “I thank President Muhammadu Buhari for giving Nigerians the opportunity to vote for their preferred candidates. “Any candidate that won is as a result of his or her efforts.” Another resident, Mrs Ramat Abdulahi, who voted in the Isolo area of Lagos, expressed hope for a renewed Nigeria. She commended Nigerians for turning out en masse to cast their votes for their preferred candidates. She said “I am happy with the whole exercise; I cast my vote in peace and went home happily. “I did not vote in the last few years, but I am happy to exercise my franchise yesterday and I pray the results turn out free and fair.” Mr Wale Raji, a lawmaker representing Epe Federal Constituency, also expressed delight at the voting exercise. He said residents’ conduct was impressive, and the atmosphere was peaceful and orderly.
