The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has denied raiding the home of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential candidate Sen. Bola Tinubu. EFCC’s Spokesperson, Wilson Uwujaren, in a statement on Sunday in Abuja, said the claim of raiding the home of the former governor of Lagos State by the commission was not true. “The attention of the EFCC has been drawn to a report circulating in the social media, claiming that operatives of the Commission raided the home of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, standard-bearer of APC, in the forthcoming presidential election and recovered a humongous sum of N400 billion. “The Commission wishes to state that no such operation was carried out by the EFCC. “The public is enjoined to disregard the report as fake news,” he said.
