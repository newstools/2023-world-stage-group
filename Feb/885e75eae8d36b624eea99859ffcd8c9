*Alleged 62 attacks on the INEC server in the last 72 hours fake WorldStage Newsonline–  Nigeria’s Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has reacted to the call by the Labour Party and the People’s Democratic Party on its Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu to resign,saying is misplaced. Mr Rotimi Oyekanmi, the Chief Press Secretary to the Chairman of INEC who said this while responding to inquiries by media said, the allegation by Dino Melaye that the INEC Chairman allocated scores to parties was unfounded and irresponsible. “At the same time, contrary to the insinuation by both parties, results emanating from the States point to a free, fair and credible process,” he said. “There are laid down procedures for aggrieved parties or candidates to follow when they are dissatisfied about the outcome of an election. Such procedures do not include calling on the INEC Chairman to resign or for the election to be cancelled. “To be sure, aggrieved parties are free to approach the courts to ventilate their concerns and wait for the matter to be resolved. Making inciting comments capable of causing violence or unrest is unacceptable. “The 2023 General election processes are in their final stages of completion. It is only fair for aggrieved parties to allow the conclusion of the process and approach the courts with their evidences to pursue their cases.” On the allegation that there were “162 attacks on the INEC server in the last 72 hours”, he said it was a figment of the imagination of source of that information. “The Commission is not aware of any 162 attacks on any server,” he said.
