It said although the agriculture sector grew by 2.05 per cent in the fourth quarter, its performance was significantly hampered by severe incidences of flood experienced across the country. “This accounted for lesser growth relative to the fourth quarter of 2021 which was 3.58 per cent.’’ The report, however, said the Industry sector was yet challenged recording -0.94 per cent growth and contributing less to the aggregate GDP relative to Q3 2022 and Q4 2021. It said overall, the annual GDP growth rate in 2022 stood at 3.10 per cent, from the 3.40 per cent reported in 2021. “Thus, the performance of agriculture and industry reduced in 2022 relative to 2021, while the performance of the services sector improved in 2022.’’ The report said in Q4 of 2022, aggregate GDP stood at N56, 757,889.95 million in nominal terms “This performance is higher when compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 which recorded aggregate GDP of N49,276,018.23 million, indicating a year-on-year nominal growth of 15.18 per cent.’’ A breakdown by sector showed that crude oil production in the fourth quarter of 2022 recorded an average daily oil production of 1.34 million barrels per day (mbpd). “This was higher than the third quarter of 2022 production volume of 1.20mbpd by 0.14mbpd.’’ The NBS said the oil sector contributed 4.34 per cent to the total real GDP in Q4 2022.
