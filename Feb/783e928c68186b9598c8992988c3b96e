WorldStage Newsonline– As frustrations over access to naira and fuel scarcity grow across Nigeria, some protesters on Tuesday blocked the Benin-Ore-Lagos Express Road leaving thousands of travelers from other parts of the country stranded. It’s a very busy major road that connects travelers from the west, east and northern part of the country to Lagos, the commercial capital. One affected traveler at Ore intersection shared pictures of the long traffic with WorldStage and lamented that they were just sitting in the vehicle not knowing what to expect. Many motorcycle operators called Okada were also busy on the road ferrying  local people and some travelers across the blocked section of the road.
