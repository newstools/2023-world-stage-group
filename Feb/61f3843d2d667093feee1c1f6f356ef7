WorldStage Newsonline–  Following the killing of Labour Party senatorial candidate in the Enugu East Senatorial District, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), has suspended senatorial election in the district, made up of six Local Government Areas, 77 Wards, and 1,630 Polling Units. The commission said the election will now be combined with the Governorship and State Assembly elections held in the next two weeks on 11th March 2023, and that materials already delivered for the senatorial election will remain in the custody of the Central Bank in the State until the new date for the election. INEC Chairman Prof Mahmood Yakubu who disclosed during a daily press briefing on the preparation of the 2023 general election said he was pleased with the progress of the commission in terms of the movement of materials to various locations around the country. He said, “Having deployed these materials to the Local Government Areas, we are today devolving the deployment to the Registration Area Centers (RACs) so that early morning tomorrow the polls will open as planned. These RACs have been activated and election duty staff have started arriving in them.” Following a report that the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has withdrawn from participating as adhoc officers in three local government areas in Imo State for the presidential and national assembly elections as a result of insecurity, Prof Yakubu said, “From the report, we received from our State office, concerns have been expressed about the security situation in Osu Local Government Area, five Wards in Okigwe and six in Orlu. “However, we have been assured that with enough mobilisation of security personnel to the area, it is possible for elections to hold in these locations. I have been in touch with the IGP who will brief us on their plans to secure these locations for elections to hold peacefully when he addresses us shortly”.
