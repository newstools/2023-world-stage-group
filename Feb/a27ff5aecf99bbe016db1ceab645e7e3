China has resumed regular passenger flights with 58 countries since the country announced removal of certain COVID-19 restrictions on international passenger flights on Jan. 8. Shang Kejia, an official with the Civil Aviation Administration of China, told a news conference on Thursday in Beijing that from Feb. 6 to 12, some 98 domestic and overseas airlines operated 795 flights, up 65 per cent from the week from Jan. 2 to 8. The number of countries and airlines was also up 64 per cent and 80 per cent, respectively, compared to the same period in 2019. Shang said the domestic air transport market would continue to see rapid expansion, adding that the number of flights would likely exceed the pre-epidemic level. According to him, the expected increase in international flights would be driven by the gradual resumption of demand for international business, tourism and education.
