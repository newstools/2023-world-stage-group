A former President of the Senate, Dr Bukola Saraki, has commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on the peaceful conduct of the Presidential and Senatorial elections in Kwara. He told newsmen in Ilorin after casting his vote on Saturday that the conduct of the elections was satisfactory. Saraki, also a former governor of the state, however expressed worry over the delay in commencement of the exercise. He therefore called on INEC to extend the voting time by two hours so as to allow voters exercise their civil rights. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the former senate president, in company of his wife, Mrs Toyin Saraki, cast their votes at their polling unit, Ode Opobiyi, 005, Ajikobi, Ilorin, at 12.30 p.m.
