…Tinubu says Nigeria will recover from challenges President Muhammadu Buhari has declared that the All Progressives Congress Presidential Candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, will be the next President of Nigeria. President Buhari made the declaration in Lafia, capital of Nasarawa State, on Saturday at the APC Presidential Campaign rally that had thousands of party supporters and residents. The president confirmed Asiwaju Tinubu’s earlier statement on their over 20 years friendship, assuring Nigerians and the people of Nasarawa State that the APC presidential candidate would be a good President that will make the country better after him. President Buhari assured party members and supporters that Asiwaju Tinubu would win the election. In both English and Hausa, the president said: “I am happy to be part of the campaign today for Bola Ahmed Tinubu as the next President of Nigeria and Governor Sule for his second and final term. “We will win through and through. I trust Tinubu’s dedication and service. I have known Bola Tinubu for more than 20 years. I will continue to campaign for him. He is a committed Nigerian and I believe he will give everything to make Nigeria better. “He loves this country. He is a believer in Nigeria and I am sure he will do everything possible to advance the wellbeing of all of us as citizens. He will hold this country with trust. You should cherish him. “Those of you who are here I urge you to go back to your friends and family to tell them to vote for him. We will all vote for Bola Ahmed Tinubu as president.” In his own address at the rally, Asiwaju Tinubu saluted the courage of the President who he said continues to offer leadership with boldness and courage despite all the challenges, adding that the country will recover from her challenges. Speaking further, the APC Presidential Candidate compared President Buhari with former United States President Abraham Lincoln who also led his country in a time of crisis and still recorded huge achievements in infrastructural development like President Buhari has done for Nigeria. On his friendship and relationship with the President, Tinubu said those who have concluded there is a crack have had their joy cut short because their friendship is strong, enduring and about nation-building. “Our President and Leader of APC worldwide, it is a thing of joy that you a poster boy for APC and Bola Tinubu today. Those who think there are cracks in our friendship and relationship will continue to be disappointed and have their short time joy dashed. Ours is not about individuals. It is about integrity and nation-building. “Nobody ever thought a man in uniform will ever be a democratic, principled and honoured Leader. Today, it is a thing of joy and honour to have you at the rally. “For us who joined hands with you 20 years ago to reshape Nigeria, to fight corruption, to fight destitution, to fight failure and hunger, we are proud of your achievements. “President Buhari faced the challenges of Nigeria courageously and squarely. You fought hard and worked hard. Nigeria is surviving as a nation and we believe because of constitutional democracy, we would have asked you to stay on but you said no you are going back to Daura. “You said there is more to do and you will allow other people to continue. There are few leaders who have faced some challenges, crisis like you did and continue to build infrastructure. One of them is Abraham Lincoln. You have joined such great men who can stay focused in the midst of distractions and enemies. You have tolerated criticisms, there is no labelling you have not endured but today in Nasarawa you are celebrated, commissioning projects after projects. “We can see true leadership but we may not be able to read the mind of the leader. Today, I stand before you and make a pledge again that Nigeria will recover from all challenges. We are brave. We are resilient. We will focus on agriculture, we will build our mineral resources. We will turn the earth and our dust to money. We will work hard. We promise you. Your children and grandchildren will not have any regret about our nation and ourselves. Happiness, joy and prosperity will be part of our success,” said Asiwaju Tinubu. National Chairman of APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, addressed the rally in Hausa.
