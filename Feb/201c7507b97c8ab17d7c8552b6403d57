Chief Executive Officer, Oduncreamz Confectionery, Odunayo Taiwo, has stressed the need for collaboration among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), stating that such actions produced the best results in a brand. She disclosed this to the New Agency of Nigeria (NAN) during the opening of a new outlet at Anthony, Lagos. Stressing the need to invest in mentorship, she reiterated the firm’s commitment to delivery of quality products and services with non-stop thrilling experiences. “Invest in classes and programs run by mentors and keep a good relationship with them. There is a place of a growing relationship with people that you see are going in your direction. “You have to be international about how you relate with them. Don’t look for barriers, make sure you do what you have to,” she said. Taiwo said the new outlet was necessary to multiply results from the online platform, adding that the space in the home was no longer sufficient to accommodate equipment and training. “This outlet would create more awareness for our brand because I was feeling there is a limit to what we do online. “I feel that we should just be out there where people can see and reach out more beyond the online platform,” she added. Taiwo, who has been in Lagos for four years, said that her inspiration could come from anywhere as she leveraged on happenings around and her spirituality to learn and grow. She said the new outlet had adequate space to accommodate training for beginners especially. As a passionate teacher, she said she desired the brand to grow into establishing a cake university and establish more franchise. Some of Nigeria’s topmost Cake firms, such as Dripples, Dewdrops and Cakes ’R’ Us alongside other bakers were present at the opening.
