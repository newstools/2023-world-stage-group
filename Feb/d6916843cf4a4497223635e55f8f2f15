The National Orientation Agency (NOA) has appealed to Nigerians to come out en mass to vote on Saturday and  eschew all forms of malpractice during the general elections. The NOA Director in Kaduna State, Alhaji Zubair Galadima- Soba, made the call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday. “We are currently sensitising citizens across the state on the proper way to vote and the dangers of violence during and after elections on the nation’s democracy. “The Electorate must be law abiding and should desist from vote buying and selling; no one should be in possession of any weapon or be seen campaigning for any candidate or party at polling units,’’ he said The director said that persons living with disability would be allowed to vote by themselves or should come to the polling centres with a trusted guide that would guide them to vote for candidates of their choice. He said that there was no need for the electorate to wait at the polling centres or follow the ballots to collation centers, saying the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) would send results directly to INEC server. Galadima-Soba explained that the agency was collaborating  with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to serve as domestic observers, to observe the elections and make reports. He said NOA officers would be deployed to polling units closest to them to observe and report the election processes. Galadima-Soba noted that NOA would continue to sensitise the general public on election matters until the elections were over.
